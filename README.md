## Hey there!  👋 I'm Annika

### 🌟 About Me
Good humor, curiosity, and a willingness to learn are my strengths.  Communication is a big part of my current job, and I love to motivate others, be motivated, and continuously learn new things.

Development and coding are still quite new to me - I'm a junior in the field - but I have the motivation and drive to keep getting better every day! 

### 🎯 What I'm Up To
- 🏃‍♀️ **Scrum Master** for a 5-person dev team at school (3 devs + 1 QA + me!)
- 📚 Learning front-end development:  **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**
- 🚀 Leading a short-term project sprint (wrapping up soon!)
- 🔌 Exploring **Agile methodology (Scrum)** and **API calls**

### 💡 What I Love
- 🤝 Collaboration and teamwork
- 📊 Keeping projects organized and moving forward
- 🧠 Problem-solving and continuous learning
- 💬 Communication and motivation
